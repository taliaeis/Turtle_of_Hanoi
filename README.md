# Turtle_of_Hanoi
The code in this repo is meant to be used in a Tower of Hanoi lab, like those often done in intro programming classes. Students can specify which disk to move from which post to which other post, and this code will
animate that using the turtle module.

driver.py contains the code necessary to make this work. sample.py provides bare-bones code demonstrating how to use the functions defined in driver.py.
